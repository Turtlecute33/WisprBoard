TurtleBoard is a privacy-conscious and customizable open-source keyboard, forked from [HeliBoard](https://github.com/HeliBorg/HeliBoard) (which is based on AOSP / OpenBoard).

## What's different from HeliBoard?

TurtleBoard adds the following features on top of HeliBoard:

- **AI Voice-to-Text** — On-device audio recording with transcription via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API. Bring your own API key, choose your preferred model, and customize the transcription prompt. Your audio never touches a server you don't control.
- **Settings performance improvements** — Optimized settings screens for smoother navigation and reduced recomposition overhead.
- **Separate application ID** — Can be installed side-by-side with HeliBoard without conflicts.

## Setup

1. Install from [Releases](https://github.com/Turtlecute33/TurtleBoard/releases/latest)
2. Enable TurtleBoard in **Settings > System > Keyboard**
3. For voice input: open **TurtleBoard Settings > Voice Input**, enter your OpenRouter API key, and enable **Voice Input**
4. In the keyboard, long-press the **Return** key and tap the voice button to start recording
